MusicPalace Project SRS Evaluation
==================================

Nice job on this, a very good work.

Some suggestions.

Be careful specifying things like "almost instantly" -- that's hard to
quantify.  Instead set some upper bound and say within that limit.  For
example, in requirement "5.3.8" specify it as "within one second".

These are "philosophy of requirements" issues that you can apply in a
*general* way to nearly all the requirements in the document.  However,
in the essence of time remaining, I'm assigning full credit to this
deliverable, for both the initial and the final submissions.

You don't have to do anything further with this document if you don't
feel the need to do so.

Deliverable D-02: 15% out of 15% = 100% which is an A-plus
Deliverable D-05:  5% out of  5% = 100% which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
