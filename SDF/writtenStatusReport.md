Me and Elizabeth have the structure of MusicPalace written out and we are currently
in the progress of completing the login, setting up our database, and finding a new API.
We have run into a little trouble storing music cause of copywrite issue and most
API's only give a portion of the song which is quite disappointing so we are currently
working on 2 work arounds. The first is to keep looking for an API that allows us
to actually access the entire song, while another is to use the youtube API and find a
way to take the first search result and output it, but this would limit us in many ways.
Even though it may limit us at least its allows a user to listen to most songs. The login
is taking a little longer than we thought because we have never used Neo4j to integrate it
with our HTML and JS and we may change the database to mongoose for convince sake and how much
easier it is to integrate with JS. That is currently what we are working on and we may
for time reasons work on the access of songs last because of the legal issues and just
move on and make the application with a small data sample until we can figure out
how to access music legally and effectively.
