This week we worked on the work around for the API and made some decent progress on that,
as well as made some adjustment to our database design and updated our previous documents
so they hold the current ERD and schema of our current database. We did fall a little behind
cause of problems with scheduling and the unexpected learning curve, but should be able to
finish what we wanted but with a little less leeway room.
